# AOE3 Loader

The loader should be copied into the same directory as the `age3x.exe` and then it can be simply launched to start an AOE process without Build limits and without population cap.

This loader only works for a very specific game version, which is not checked by the loader.

## TODO

1. Check game version and print out error if version doesn't match
2. Make population cap configurable
